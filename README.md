### Project Overview:
This project focuses on building and training a machine learning model to predict flight cancellations in the United States. 

### Data Source:
Since the files we used are too large to for GitHub, we have attached a link below to our data source. We specifically used the 2022.csv and 2023.csv files for our data

We used: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-dataframes-in-pyspark/

### Cleaning and Loading:

### Machine Learning:
For our machine learning model, we used a supervised learning as we knew the values of the cancelled flights.

### Future Work:
